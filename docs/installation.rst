Sermin will work with Python 2.7 and 3.2 upwards.

.. TODO: confirm python 3 support

Installation
============

Install sermin using pip::

    pip install sermin

This will install all required dependencies and add the ``sermin`` command to
your system - see :doc:`usage` for more details.

Sermin can also be installed into a virtual environment.

Alternatively, you can install the development version direct from github::

    pip install -e git+https://github.com/radiac/sermin@develop#egg=sermin

This may contain changes made since the last version was released - these will
be listed in the :ref:`changelog`.

If you are planning to contribute to Sermin, you may want to install with the
dev extra requirements - see :doc:`contributing` for more details.
